# KeyLikeUNIX
### Have you ever thought why keyboard layout is so inefficient?

Mostly used Ctrl key is just hiding in very corner of keyboard, rarely used Caps Lock occupies golden place,

Every pressing ESC key in vim makes your left hand away from right place. This is UNFAIR!!

In Linux there's system settings to reassign keys in one's taste, but Windows isn't.

So, here's registries that reassign keys to make a UNIX-Like experience.
### Files
1. ctrlcaps_escaccent_swap.reg
   
   Swaps Ctrl <-> CapsLock, and ESC <-> `(~)key, most recommended.
   
2. ctrlcaps_swap.reg
   
   Swaps Ctrl <-> CapsLock, recommended for normal Windows users(who doesn't use Vim).
   
3. escaccent_swap.reg
   
   Swaps ESC <-> `(~)key, recommended for Vim enthusiast but cannot give up Ctrl based shortcuts.
   
4. remove_all_swap.reg

   Remove all key reassignments.

Every registry file works after reboot.

Best wish for your productivity.
